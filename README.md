# VCG Auction Implementation
By Allison Gong

## To Clone
```
git clone https://github.com/AllisonArtG/CS618_PS1.git
```

## To Run
In the directory, the following command from the terminal/command line.
```
python3 random_gen.py
```

## User Guide
1. random_gen.py functions as the main file.
2. For more succinct output, comment out the line `print_results(allocations, payments)`
in the main function of random_gen.py.
3. If you want to see the actual values assigned to every agent for every subset of items,
comment in the line `print("agents\n", agents`. However, the outputed nested dictonaries
are increasingly large.
